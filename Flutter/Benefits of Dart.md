### [[About Dart]] has following benefits:

- Use of **async** and **await** for asynchronous programming.
  
- Very few languages that is well suited to being compiled both AOT (Ahead of time) and JIT (just in time) for **Hot restart** and **Hot Reload**
  
  - JIT compilation is used during development, using a compiler that is especially fast. When app is ready it is compiled using AOT
    
  - Extremely fast development cycles, fast execution and startup times
    
  - Dart can be compiled into JS so it can be executed in browsers
