1. **Supervised ML** - We give the input and output data and the ML model tries to develop relationships and patterns around the i/o and o/p.

	official def: Supervised learning uses a training set to teach models to yield the desired output. This training dataset includes inputs and correct outputs, which allow the model to learn over time. The algorithm measures its accuracy through the loss function, adjusting until the error has been sufficiently minimized.

	*Types of Supervised ML* - 
	
	a) Regression - When both the input and output data is numerical.
	b) Classification - When the output is categorized.

2. **Unsupervised ML** - We only have input data and no output.

3. **Batch Learning** - Train the entire model with the entire data at once in your local machine and deploy the trained model in production.

	problem - Static model, only be trained once, we have to keep retraining our model and re-deploying
