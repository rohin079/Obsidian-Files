Let me summarize the changes we've made to implement the new feature for assigning tasks to all annotators:

1. **Added New State Management**:
    - Added a toggle switch state (`assignToAllAnnotators`)
    - Added state for storing annotator data (`annotators`)
2. **Added Annotator Fetching**:
    - Integrated your existing `getAllAnnotators` function
    - Set up fetching when the dialog opens
    - Used the fetched data to determine the number of task repeats
3. **Added UI Elements**:
    - Added a Switch component for toggling the "assign to all annotators" feature
    - Added a label showing the number of available annotators
    - Made the repeat count input disable when auto-assignment is on
4. **Modified Task Generation Logic**:
    - Updated `generateFilledTemplates` to handle annotator assignments
    - When toggle is ON:
        - Sets repeat count to match number of annotators
        - Creates a copy of each task for each annotator
        - Assigns each task copy to a specific annotator
    - When toggle is OFF:
        - Maintains original behavior
        - Uses manual repeat count
        - Creates tasks without specific assignments
5. **Task Creation Adaptations**:
    - Modified the task creation structure to include an optional `assignedTo` field
    - Updated the task naming to reflect annotator assignments

The end result is that users now have two options:

1. Traditional method: Manually set repeat count and create unassigned tasks
2. New auto-assign method: Toggle on to automatically create one copy per annotator and assign each copy to a specific annotator

Would you like to focus on any specific part of these changes or shall we test the implementation?
